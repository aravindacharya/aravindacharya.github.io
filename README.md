## Research Interests
My research interests are in the areas of developing domain specific languages and optimizing compilers for high performance. I'm currently a post-doctoral researcher at NVIDIA. I obtained my PhD under the supervison of Dr. Uday Reddy Bondhugula from the Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institue of Science. My PhD thesis focussed on developing a scalable, automatic loop transformation framework using the polyhedral model. I am working on providing automated compiler technologies for high performance computing in multicore and manycore architectures, using the polyhedral framework.

My master's thesis work with Dr. K V Raghavan was on model-checking in counter automata. In this work, we provided a framework for model-checking CTL properties in a class of Presburger counter systems. The key novelty in this work was the use of existing reachability analysis tools as black-boxes.
